== Integration
For the integration, we used the concept of a finite-state machine to encapsulate all our tasks. To do so, we created a module called task selector which runs all tasks at once. Depending on the switches selected, the respective tasks get selected. The table below shows the switch combination

*Regardless of switch selected, all tasks will be initialized once.*

*Based on the switches selected, the respective output will be assigned to an intermediate value.*

*The intermediate value will be assigned to the BASYS3’s seven-segments, LED and speaker at the end of the module.*
